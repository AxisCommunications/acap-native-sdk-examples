# How to make a contribution

Have you found an issue or have a question? Here you find different ways to
contribute to this repository.

## Create a change and open a Pull Request

To make a contribution, you need to [fork the
repository](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
Forking a repository means you create a copy of it in your GitHub account. A
fork is necessary because by default repositories only grant you read access,
but your fork gives you write access to make your changes. The fork lets you
suggest changes by opening Pull Requests (PRs) from your fork to the "upstream"
Axis repository.

### Guidelines for contributions

Before opening a PR, make sure to follow these guidelines

- The sample code builds perfectly fine on your local system.
- The update follows the [example guidelines](EXAMPLE_GUIDELINES.md).

  message style in the commit messages.
